# Using BrandCAPTCHA with ASP

The BrandCAPTCHA ASP Library provides a simple way to place a Brand[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) on your ASP website, helping you stop bots from abusing it. The library wraps the BrandCAPTCHA API.

After you've obtained your API keys, you will only need to include the file "brandcaptchalib.asp" at the beginning of your web page.

The file "example.asp" contains an example code that you can use as a template for your site.
